ðŸ›’ QuickCart: An E-Commerce Cart App
Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called QuickCart. It's a simple and beginner-friendly e-commerce cart system I built using React.

You can check out the live site here: https://ecommerce-three-delta-47.vercel.app/

The whole idea behind QuickCart was to create a really intuitive and clean cart experience. I've noticed that a lot of beginner e-commerce projects don't always get the cart functionality just right, so I wanted to build something that bridges that gap.

The app lets you browse products, add them to your cart, change the quantities, and even go through a simulated checkout process. It's all built with a focus on a clean and responsive user interface that works well on any device.

Here are some of the main features:

Product Listing: You can browse through a list of products that are fetched from a public API.

Add to Cart: Easily add items to your cart right from the product cards.

Quantity Control: You can adjust the number of items in your cart (from 1 to 10).

Real-time Pricing: The total price updates automatically as you make changes to your cart.

Checkout Flow: A simulated checkout process to show how the final steps would work.

Responsive Design: I made sure it looks great on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

For the tech-savvy, hereâ€™s what I used to build it:

Frontend: React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

Routing: React Router DOM for page navigation

API: I used mockAPI to get the product data.

Deployment: The site is deployed on Vercel.

Version Control: All the code is managed with Git and GitHub.

To build this, I gathered ideas from various online tutorials and resources. I also used some AI-powered tools to help with brainstorming and to speed up the process of writing the CSS. It was a great learning experience!
